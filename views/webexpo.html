        <h2>What is Web Exploitation?</h2>
        <p>
            Web exploitation involves finding and using vulnerabilities in
            websites or web applications to extract sensitive information,
            manipulate functionality, or bypass security measures. It is a key
            area in cybersecurity and focuses on how attackers interact with
            websites. Newbies can think of it as "figuring out how websites work
            behind the scenes and finding weak spots."
