        <h2>What is Cryptography?</h2>
        <p>
            Cryptography is the science of securing information by turning it
            into a secret code that only the intended recipient can understand.
            It ensures that data stays private and can't be read or tampered
            with by unauthorized people. Newbies can think of it as "creating
            and solving secret messages."
