        <h1>What is OSINT?</h1>

        <p>
            OSINT, or Open Source Intelligence, is the process of gathering and
            analyzing publicly available information to gain useful insights.
            This information can come from websites, social media, public
            records, or any other data that's open to everyone. Newbies can
            think of it as "being a detective on the internet, searching for
            clues that anyone can find."
