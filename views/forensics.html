        <h1>What is Forensics?</h1>
        <p>
            Forensics in cybersecurity involves investigating digital devices,
            files, or systems to uncover evidence of malicious activity or
            hidden data. It's like being a detective for computers, figuring out
            what happened, how it happened, and who did it. Newbies can think of
            it as "digging into files, logs, or metadata to solve a mystery."
