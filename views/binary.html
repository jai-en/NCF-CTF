        <h1>What is Binary Exploitation?</h1>
        <p>
            Binary exploitation is about finding vulnerabilities in compiled
            programs (binaries) and taking advantage of them to control or
            manipulate the program’s behavior. It focuses on discovering flaws
            in how programs process data and using them to execute malicious
            code. Newbies can think of it as "finding and exploiting mistakes in
            a program’s code to make it do something unexpected."
